      [vc_column_text]
        <p style="text-align: justify;">To examine seriatim following propositions, of the "new orthodoxy" of the supply of mediums of exchange:1. The supply of Treasury Bills is the effective regulatory base of the domestic banking system;2. Capability of open market operations to influencing the volume of bank deposits;3. Uniquely of the assets or group of assets compared to money;4. Possibility to put liquid assets in the place of money;5. The basis for believing that there is any limit to velocity.He concludes without violation of the traditional analysis, it to say, that:1. The cash continues being the base of the banking system, because the supply of Treasury Bills is neither a necessary and sufficient condition for a change in deposits;2. There is no structural reason why open-market operations should be ineffective;3. Assets can be uniquely identified as money (medium of exchange) if the aggregate of the class of assets to which they belong remains the same and there is no repercussion in the market for loans;4. a) In analysis of the effects of asset choice, liquidity (in the maturity sense) must be put in the place of money as the monetary factor influencing effective demand by the rate of interest and valuation effects; b) In analysis of the determinants of expenditure plans, the liquidity (in the financial strength sense) must be put in the place, of money as the factor influencing directly; c) In analysis of the effect of expending decisions the availability of money be retained as a factor capable of influencing the ex-post realisations of such decision because of its unique position as the medium of exchange;5. a) When the volume of money is large, monetary restriction is ineffective because velocity of circulation can increase without constraint; b) The development ex non-bank financial intermediaries causes a secular increase in the velocity of circulation, but the credit which they create is based upon money.</p>

      [vc_column_text]
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Although it is true regional differences are evident in most countries, in Italy they have a major importance on account of the extension and intensity of underdevelopment existing in the Mezzogiorno. A problem region whose origin goes back to more than a century ago, and encompassing a little less than half the italian territory with twenty millions inhabitants, the Mezzogiorno has s reduced "per-capita" income, just half the national means.In 1950 Italy began a development policy in the Mezzogiorno; at the beginning it was direct towards improving and transforming the agricultural structure. To carry out its policy it was then created what now is known as Cassa del Mezzogiorno.The House progressively extended its influence once the forticating process of the substructure capital in the agricultural sector was firmly settled.The House has the following means of action: a) common action in the public administration through its investments; b) straight forward action of the House with resource of its own; c) facilities to foster new industrial inversions such as: customs exemptions, tax reduction, etc.; d) investments that in some obligatory proportion have to be made by semi-public enterprises.It can be said, in general, that up to now the results achieved are highly positive.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">During his office in the National Congress and from the seat of the Presidency of the Republic, Pellegrini devoted himself to estate matters.Ideologically, he took part in the argentine liberal heterodox current.Possessing a realistic spirit, he tried hard to put into practice the principles of neo mercantilism. He conceived leading in function of the economic development and the thought of free-trade as one of the most intelligent ways of protection the British industry during the XIX century.He limited his economic policy to these points: a) continue fostering the agricultural and cattle industry; and b) promote, through national protectionism, the rise of manufacturing industries, especially those private enterprises which used a first rate argentine raw material.The national industry being organized, and the internal market settled, any kind of protection, which is always limited in time, ceased. Then, a new stage began, that of free trading and the nation would therefore enter the international market.</p>
