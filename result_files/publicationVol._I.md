        <p style="text-align: justify;">When a Crown-possession, Argentina's economic life suffered the gravitation of Spain and, alter 1810 that of England. Some efforts towards liberation were made during the period between 1830 and 1850. The influence, however, culminated after 1853 with the triumph of liberalism and the ensuing enslaving predominance of the English market. The free exchange caused the disappearance of local industry and the subsistence as a factory until very recent times. Due to problems created by two gruesome world wards, the most important countries started to apply planified economies. Although with some delay, Argentina too has fixed her plan in order to face the consequences of the second world war which, even if she remained a spectator, dealt her some blows. General Perón started to trace his plan from the so-called Postwar Council, projecting his First Plan for the period 1947-1952; according to his own statement, the Plan was deficient by lack of information on the true situation of the country the Presidency of which he had just assumed. However, even so, it allowed for the execution of more than 75.000 Public Works and an ever greater number of actions of a moral and institutional character.In 1952 and so as to face the crisis caused by the total loss of the 1951- harvest and two only partial harvests in the previous years, the so- called Economic Plan found its application.The Economic Plan 1952 formed the link with the Second Five-Year Plan which was approved by the Argentina Congress in December 1952.The Second Five-Year Plan is far superior to the First One, as five years were spent on collecting information elements in narrow cooperation with institution specially created to that purpose as well as with all kinds of public and private organisms, joined in an effort to realize an outstanding performance.Its principal aim is: to consolidate Economic Independence; to assure Social Justice and to maintain Political Sovereignty.It is not just an Economic Plan; it is an Integral Plan comprising social, economic, cultural, military and political problems. It is not, as has so well been expressed both by President Perón and the Minister for Technical Affairs in their message to the Argentina Parliament, totalitary; both have put into evidence this outstanding feature of Argentine planning. The State does not direct the activities of the people; it just guides, fosters or facilities them. Neither free initiative nor social economic and political activity of people's organizations are restricted; the State simply offers its assistance for achieving the aim fixed of a well balanced harmony.Another outstanding feature of the Plan is the method used for its achievement i. e. persuasion. Let the people of the Nation first get aware of the advantages planned and it will give its assistance.A third feature is that of the order of preference established for its development. First of all, attention will be given to the social problems and, thereafter to the ones of an economic character, among which agriculture and cattle-breeding doubtlessly representing the country's principal wealth- are to occupy the first place without, however, neglecting thereby industrial production. It also plans to reactivate the economic boundaries, giving preference to the country's southern territories. And even if the economic situation is not so bright as it was when the First Plan entered into force, the application of the Second will take on a more accelerated rhythm when circumstances change for the better, in proportion to that improvement.</p>

      [vc_column_text]
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The usual approach of world-economy in the form of a international relation, neglects both the details of the spacial position among national economies themselves, and the spatial economic relations  similar to the international ones- within the big nations. Therefore, it is necessary to replace it by one spatial approach, considering the world  circular flow of goods as one unit, and which, only after having determined the spatial order of world-economy- traces the boundaries of the nations within that order. Only on a spatial economic basis, problems arising from relations between national space and economic space can be understood.According to such an approach, world-economy is a kind of spatial order, concentrically arranged around three industrial gravitational fields, each of them with a heavy-industry core, viz: the northamerican field, the european and the soviet ones. The european gravitation-field formed itself during the integration-phase of world-economy, as a consequence of the industrial revolution in England; the Northamerican gravitation-field is the result of the expansion period of world-economy, within which, on the basis of marginal cores within its space, a second gravitation-field developed jointly with the extension of world-economy in overseas underpopulated areas.The soviet gravitation field  just as was previously the case with the strong Japanese core  originated during the intensification  phase of world-economy in densely populated areas. Moreover, nowhere else in the world either the immensity of space or agrarian productivity succeeded in developing an agrarian basis strong enough to create an industrial gravitation field. Nevertheless, on the outskirts of world-economy, powerful marginal cores have been formed, today present in all their evolution stages, from the formation of small centrifugal industries to the beginning of a heavy industry, passing through the average consume-goods and production means industries. Many a time, autarchic efforts caused those cores to trespass the boundaries fixed by the principle of international labour-division. However, such a development becomes delicate in such cases where industrialization is extended beyond the limits fixed for the development-possibilities of the national boundary economy. In such cases, and due to the fact that economic weakness endangers political aims, Politics will be called to order by Economy.</p>

      [vc_column_text]
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The author has been invited to give some explanation of the reasons for the chronical deficit in Public Accounts during the present postwar-time and tries to show that we are dealing with a general problem which cannot merely be explained either as a consequence of corruption of employees or as the effect of the wasting of Public Funds. On the contrary, its cause has only to be sought in the increase of public expenses and the shortage in public income to cope with them. The ever-increasing intervention of the State in Economic Life is the main cause of the ever-higher increase in expenses and the purpose of the author is to analyses this problem. The respective expenses are originated by the higher efficiency of Public Administrations, by the increasing solidarity between the various sectors of the State and the individual, as well as by the formation of huge economic entities, fighting each other or joining their forces in order to dominate the market and, finally, by an increase of the Public Administration's social aid. Such a progressive intervention is nothing new. It is a phenomenon ever on the move and which can be observed from times immemorial, originated by the development of both technique and psychology of the masses and which should neither be stopped nor can be avoided.Therefore, the authors wonders, why the available income proves more and more inadequate to the ever- increasing expenses and he points out that the actual financial system, though of use in the past, has become obsolete. The system proved useful in times when public expenses could be covered by a proportionally modest part of the taxes which, moreover and in case of need, could be increased temporarily. However, if, as is now the case, the current financial requirements of the State can only be met by maintaining the permanent contributions continuously on a relatively high level, then the collection of taxes may experience difficulties and create a certain tension between the taxpayers and the Fisc, which makes the income inadequate and discourages production. On the other hand, the deficiency of the present financial system asks at certain movements for certain adaptations and the general trend seems to be towards a progressive socialisation of economic activities. It remains, however, to be seen whether in practice the actual rhythm is the right one or whether it is either too slow or too fast.</p>

      [vc_column_text]
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The increase in productivity, already known in the twenties under the name of rationalisation and as such only as a private economic aim- has become, after the second world ward, one of the most important tasks of Economic Policy. It owes its actuality to the circumstance that, without an increase in productivity, it would not be possible to reach an increase in export-capacity. Moreover, neither a high standard of living nor a high employment-level can be reached and maintained without an increase in productivity.It is extremely difficult to give an exact definition as to the concept of productivity. Like Sombart, the author makes a difference between a technical and an economical concept of productivity (Rentability). In both cases, there exists the relation between the effort and the result; only, whereas the former deals with a material concept, the latter involves one relating to value; the author gives preference to the former.The productivity- increase policy is subject to two conditions: Stability of Currency and an Avoiding of conjunctural underemployment as well as that of conjuctural-political overemployment. The former, because currency- fluctuations hamper initiative, make long-term measures difficult and paralyze capital-saving; the latter as, on one hand, overemployment is tied up with inflation-processes, and creates a kind of monopoly between employers and employees whereas, on the other hand, under employment leads to a decreasing productivity-capacity and increased expenses.The first approach to productivity-increase is Instruction and Education, because productivity increase, is at the same time, a problem of knowledge, Capacity and, above all, of Will. The second and most efficient one would be the Fostering of efficiency competition. The third approach would be that of a Fiscal and Salary Policy.As to its application, this policy has its limits: in the first place, there exists the other aims of Economic Policy, the total realization of one economic purpose is, more often, achieved at the expense of other ones. Secondly, there is the lack of comprehensive and technical knowledge. Another important factor  according to Schumpeter- is the existence of that dynamic pioneer-spirit in owners and which the author extends also to labourers and consumers. Finally, and not with standing numerous opinions to the contrary, also the degree of saving-disposition forms a limit because, without capital-formation, i.e. without saving, the realization of new, labour-saving production-means becomes an impossibility.</p>

      [vc_column_text]
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Leaving aside value-theories or any other explanation of a qualitative order, the author intends to determine, through a strictly quantitative examination, the neutral or central exchanges valuation between two kinds of wealth.For two kinds of wealth, produced in such quantities as to cover their respective normal consume-necessities, the neutral or central exchange valuation can be determined by the existing proportion between the global quantities of same. Thus, for goods "x" and "y" even in case of a change in their quantities- the same proportion will be maintained as when global quantities under normal circumstances were concerned:X/Y = Cx/CyIt may occur that in several transactions the real prices would not coincide with that valuation rate. However, and generally speaking, the theoretical rate will be valid, with the exception of such cases where an apparent shortage or rareness of some product would provoke a re adjustment in the sense of the neutral rate. In case of consume-in sufficiency or a consume under the normal level, the author shows that the same proportion or neutral rate is applicable from the moment it contains the representative quantitative factor of the economic importance of those goods. This factor expresses the relative differences between the existing quantities of the goods as compared with those of their respective normal consume. The named factor is statistically determined.Moreover, be considers the dynamic treatment of the problem, taking as a starting point that a normal consume of goods covers neither moments nor instants, but periods of time, and that its variation can be synthesized in increase or readjustment valuations enabling the neutral exchange valuation to take into consideration the fluctuations adherent to economic life. Finally, he defends the thesis of theoretical solution of economic problems based on their normal consume-function rather than on the premises of economic abnormalities.</p>

      [vc_column_text]
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays it is compulsory, when applying the Philosophy of Science, to take into account two real facts: the present state of Science as well as the problematical circumstances of the 20th Century scientist.It is a fact that, although man has learned to solve many a problem by means of science, than latter alone is not sufficient to solve all of them, as somehow or other, it is unable to do so. We think, for instance of those of the very science when, in a crisis-period, she has to face contradictions and incompatibilities. It then becomes evident that we need either an autoreflexion or a second-degree reflexion in our thoughts, which is the moment when we enter the territory of Philosophy of Science.Based on historical facts, we know that a crisis in Economic Science takes place together with the broadening of the horizon of economic experience. The theory which up to then and in a general way applied to a sole "natural order" becomes nothing but a special theory applicable only to one specially determined economic experience. The need of a general comprehensive theory, covering the total economic reality sharpens the crisis in thought as, of necessity and so as to be genuine, it has to take the shape of a coherent unity and of a system void of all contradiction, which only can be attained on the philosophical level of Economic Knowledge.</p>
