Thus it is shown that policy recommendations based on such theories are not justified because rigidities in the economic systems would prevent many countries from attaining the degree of diversification which according to theory should follow under free trade conditions. Specialization along primary producing lines is desirable only if it assures countries adopting it, full employment of human resources or, at least, an equitable share of world income-conditions attained only under exceptional and transitory circumstances. It follows that beyond certain point further economic progress in such countries requires industrialization and protection. This part of the study supplies a logical and theoretical justification for policies which most underdeveloped countries have already adopted against the recommendations of many orthodox economists.A statistical section shows that certain well known empirical generalizations abput the development of international trade following industrialization are not valid. International trade appears as a prerequisite of industrialization rather than its result or by product. The historical expansion in the trade of the older industrial countries is only an index of their success in obtaining access to resources without which industrialization would not have been possible. Also the common belief that trade somehow will increase whenever a country industrializes or attempts- is unwarranted and proven by the fact that the reciprocal trade of the older industrial nations has tended to decline, both in absolute and relative terms, while their trade with primary producing countries has steadily expanded.The role of international trade in economic growth is then re appraised. Trade is shown to be an essential part of industrialization as its effects is that of supplementing domestic resources and making diversification possible. Since most countries have unbalanced bases of natural resources, their industrialization is dependent on attaining minimum levels of international trade. This conclusion is important for underdeveloped countries bent on industrializing, Economic integration with countries having complementary resources is shown to be the answer whenever the trade prospects of a country indicate that industrialization may be infeasible.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

In opposition to the so called social progress, social change has no teologic meaning. Social system means a structure of social processes and relations showing some regularity. The dichotomy between social statics (structures) and social dynamics (change) is therefore incorrect, because the first does not exist in reality. Cultural changes are but functions of the social changes. Among the functions which are contributions of a social system to the fundamental needs of its members to a more inclusive social system, the author distinguishes actual functions, latent or not evident functions and disfunctions (of negative effect).With regard to causation, the author points out MAV IVER's classification into distributive, collective and conjunctural phenomena. To forecast and control socio-cultural phenomena, a scientific methods is necessary. After pointing out the conditions for a correct scientific methodology, the author explains the modern complementary and qualitative trends: typology, the same combined with psychology and cultural anthropology and the "functional process", which reduces social change to a manageable analytical process. Finally, he examines five basic aspects of the social change process: social deviations, innovations, the innovation valuating process the transition phase and the institutionalization process.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

The first important progress was the construction of the market morphology followed by the macroeconomic approach culminating in KEYNES works, by LEONTIEF'S input-output model, the operational research, the linear programming and the theory of games. Another fundamental progress was achieved by considering time, both in the short run (business cycles) and the long run (economic growth) which occupies at present a central position in the scientific discussion. Finally, the recent intent to improve the one point economic model led to the spatial approach. Thus one can say that modern economic thought developed in three big directions: the first one is formed by the study of the substance of economic phenomena, the second considers time and the third includes space in its approach to economics.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]
