First, he will no doubt ascertain that industrialization has called forth an increase both in the individual and the national income, and he must necessarily conclude that in spite of the fact that industrialization cannot converge towards infinite limits, these are still far from being reached, so that industry is and will remain the most dynamical element of the national economy. Even if political factors would intervened and put obstacles to its advance, all they perhaps could do, would be to detain it, but never to stop it, this because the economical factors will always have the upper hand. Secondly, he will ascertain that all over the world, industrialization has begun with the manufacturing of the consumer's goods, and only later after a larger or shorter period, passed to that of investment goods. Innumerable examples demonstrate that not raw material shortage could be a decisive factor, but the form in which the necessities are satisfied and the possibility to replace at given moment, the raw material by some adequate substitute. Again, another fact will call the observer's attention; the continued tendency of industry to move towards the regions of production of raw materials, and this in spite of the fact that these regions themselves are making every effort to create an industry of their own. All this evidently, cannot remain without influencing the whole structure of the markets and the commerce of the world, and without causing profound social changes. The author concludes his study with some considerations on the future of the economical and industry world.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

Indeed, all of them take it for granted that the individual is able to control all economic variables. This is not and cannot be true, except in a pure Robinson-economy. Much more appropriate and natural is to operate with the similarity existing between economic life and games of strategy, as both have a trait in common, which cannot be found in physics. In poker, skat or any other game of strategy, the final result does not depend on the behavior of one of the players, but is a component of the behavior of all players, as each dominates only a part of the variables, the totality of which decides the final result.We have to distinguish between the two-person zero-sum games, in which the interest of the players are exactly opposite, and the n-person games. Further, the two-person games are divided in strictly determined games and those non strictly determined. In the first there is always an optimal strategy for both players, whatever the opponent does. This peculiar situation is called the saddle point of the function, viz, the point where in the matrix the maximum of the row minima is equal to the minimum of the column maxima. In the non strictly determined games no visible saddle point exists. Nevertheless, in 1928 VON NEUMANN proved in his mathematical study,  that even in this kind of games there is to be found an optimal strategy, which can be determined. This is just the kind of strategy which is to be met with in social and economic life. The n-person games throw a light on the problems of coalition (cartels, syndicates, cooperatives, etc.) as well as on the problem of imputation, which up to now have not found a general solution and so approaches the fundamental problem of welfare economics. One of the fundamental laws of the theory of games in that only in the inessential games (those in which a coalition does not offer any advantages to the participants) is it possible to find an imputation which can be considered to be the best. In the essential games (in which a coalition is always advantageous) there are several imputations, none of which can be considered as the optimum solution. These last ones are of great practical and theoretical interest.Pushing the investigation further, we reach the stage of the composition and decomposition of the games. By doing so we are able to drop the zero-sum restriction of the games and arrive at games with a sum different from zero or even at games whose sums are variable, which brings the theory into closer contact with economic situations. By such practice, which can be furthered by some easy mathematical tricks, we are able to amend the dominating theory of monopolies.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

But in the theory of equilibrium such equality cannot be taken as a base. More even, one should clearly distinguish between equality and equilibrium of saving and investment. Further, the author deals with the question of how to arrive to differentiate the concepts of planned and unplanned saving and investment, as this difference leads to a natural change in the level of the total revenue, which KEYNES considers as a determining factor in the theory of equilibrium. The author shows how a balanced income should be analytically as well as geometrically determined. Finally, he underlines briefly the importance of distinguishing between the equality and the equilibrium of saving and investment, taking into consideration the psychological factors in the economic theory.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

No doubt apparent inflation (whose only aim is to adjust the volume of the circulating money to that of increasing business activities, being thus necessary and justified) is something else than real inflation (characterized by an excess of money in no relation with the real volume of business). It is the latter which causes the value of the currency to drop, the prices to rise and which destroys the equilibrium of the cost of living, specially for those with set revenues.In Brasil, the index of the cost of living rose from 100 (1939 taken as basis) to 695,6 (1953), which represents an increase of 595,3%. Consequently, the purchasing power of the money dropped from 100 to 14,37.This devaluation has to be ascribed to the excess of the paper money in circulation, which rose from Cr$ 4 970 926 000 (1939) to 47 002 000 000 (December 1953), thus representing an increase of 845,55%. During the same period of time, the business volume showed an increase of only 250,25%; the rest, 595,3% provoked an increase in the cost of living.Further, experience has shown that inflation causes a tremendous rise in the value of real estates; fro examples in Sao Paulo, a property valued in 1947 at Cr 300 000, could not be bought in April 1954 for less than 1 000 000; the housing problem became alarming.The depreciation of the currency, impoverishing one class of the society and enriching others, impairs the relations between them. Such phenomena, when it appears, are nearly always caused by currency matters.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

It is an undeniable fact that the economists have frequently changed their spatial approach. Thus, after the vogue of the political doctrine of economic spaces, followed the geographical one and after the era of pure spaces (Lösch) followed the vogue of abstract spaces (Perroux). Nevertheless, if closely examined, one can easily verify that none of these doctrines could elucidate more than one aspect of the spatial complexity of economic phenomena, and this obliges us to abandon the unilaterality of the approach and to adopt as starting point a multilateral and complex scheme, based on a threefold concept: the economic system, the natural economic structure and the cultural economic structure, completing it with a well understood abstract spatial approach.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]
