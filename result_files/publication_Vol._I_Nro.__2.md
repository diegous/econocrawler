It is only with the Constituant Assembly, that the incoherence and the confusion began to lessen. The reforms introduced during the 19th century aimed only at getting a hold on the personal revenues, which up to that time were exempted; the principle of contributive capacity was abandoned, but no attempt till then was made to tax the professional income. It is not very long ago, since the French adopted the principle of taxing the total amount of transaction. Anyway, it cannot be said that till J. Caillaux, the French possessed what is called homogenous and coherent fiscal system. Caillaux renounced to the taxation based on the calculated amount of the tax payer's annual expenses, and introduced the principle of the income tax, but as his technicians could not find objective criteria on the base of which to define this new concepts, the principle was doomed; the French were obliged to take to the old system of indirect taxation. All law projects presented these last years have again retaken the idea of taxing the amount of living expenses and the accrued value, completely abandoning the principle of the income tax.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

In order to remedy the evils by the elimination of the old market mechanism the world had to appeal to the short-term bilateral, commodity and payment agreement system. The leading authorities of the foreign commercial relations saw in this system the best possibilities to make use of discriminating prices and quantities in dealing with their partners. The trade agreements policy is put now before the task to find means to avoid the division of the world in market and currency zones, and to eliminate, for the benefit of lasting international economics, based on fair competition, the multiple obstacles so harmful to trade by an active administrative protectionism.The contractual commercial policy must be based on complete reciprocity of all parties involved. It impedes the use of hostilities and of reprisals by balancing the import and export necessities of the respective countries. No exception should be made in the bestowal of the benefits deriving from the principle of the "Most Favoured Nation", which should be extended so as to guarantee complete equality between foreigners and nationals, with regard to the right of living, working and enjoying the legal protection within their respective countries. However, experience has shown us that the principle of the "Most Favoured Nation" does not always yield the same results for all the parties concerned, this is why the trade agreements policy has sought a remedy in the preferential and reciprocity principle.Custom tariffs are still used as a weapon for obtaining concessions form the to be partners, which once applied, automatically become "vested interest", to which, ina a new agreement, the beneficiary will not easily renounce. Once of the main problems of the trade agreement policy is how equality between Big Powers and small countries could be attained. This aim is hoped to be achieved by the so called simultaneous, multilateral system of the GATT, which extends the privileges of the bilateral agreements to all its members. However, the elusive clauses contained in the GATT- system, foster renewed protectionist tendencies by import prohibition, thus enabling those adopting such system to defend themselves against unemployment at the expense of the other countries.The economic reconstruction is not possible without the example and the contribution of a powerful nation, and this the moment for the U.S.A. to consider seriously the abolishment of its custom barriers. Nothing can be achieved by an unilateral export of capital. The contractual commercial policy is nothing else than a mere technical apparatus, which can not yield more that than quantity of comprehensive political spirit, the statement invest in it.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

The only reason of the bank's existence is its readiness to offer credit as a substitute for cash. After examining its evolution, he explains why and how it was possible to arrive at such a substitute. What makes, that a deposit at sight in a bank acquire the necessary mobility in order to satisfy the necessities of cash of a given market, at a given moment, and that the said market accept the offer of credit in replacement of cash, is only the confidence which both, the creditor and the future debtor of the bank, place in its solvability and its possibilities of mobilizing its debts and offer them as credit. The bank's iniciative of the debt is at the same time the iniciative of credit; one cannot exist without the other. The author concludes his article underlining the important part plaid by the bank as an interpreter and auxiliary in the economic and financial life.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

The present article intends to emphasize this aspect of the full-employment problem which is proven to be of the utmost importance for countries such as India, Japan, China and Indonesia, some of which moreover, have for a long time already dedicated themselves successfully to industrialization. The article tries to show that the problem of creating full-employment - in case of an unbridled increase of population - constantly renews itself in an increasingly alarming manner. The author arrives at the conclusion that full-employment policy, at the end of such a development, can give but an apparent solution.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

Because of all this, we cannot realize what actually reality is; its intimate cohesion reveals itself to us as a "something" in the ontological explanation of its intimate essence. The general theoretical approach, based on the essential constitution of this "something", shows it to us as a "whole", different from all other things, and considered as such from the viewpoint of its kind.No doubt that both, the individual empirism and the theoretical conceptualism, are component elements of the reality. This duality, which only abstractly can be differentiated, has, since the origins of the platonian logic, up to Hussers'l, formal ontology, preoccupied the philosophers in search of an ideal line, which should unite both, knowledge and reality, into a logical and ontological acception.The science is something more homogeneous, than it would appear to an outsider. The scientist perceives its unity, and more than once is operating on it, quite unconsciously. As for the difference existing in the field of fundamental principles, differences which split the unity and often are destroying it, it is the task of the science philosopher to deal with.The logos are instrumental to science, because they are conducive to final understanding by concepts, the truth of which cannot result from isolated facts.The connections between truths, and the connections between objects, can only be abstractly distinguished. All truths are in science connected by such intimate, ideal bonds, that they appear as a single complexes truth.Unity is achieved in science with the aid of principles; but not all of them have the same nature. In the nomological, analytical, abstract sciences, what is defining the sphere of every one of them, is the viewpoint of its respective theory, one or more essential, homogeneous principles, unifying and setting up the notion; as for example: the mathematical axioms. In other sciences, the synthetical, what constitutes the coordinating element of the truths, are the extra-essential viewpoints; the most immediate of these extra-essential principles is the unity of the object. These sciences refer to "one and the same individual object of one and the same empirical kind", therefore these sciences are classified as ontological sciences; their principles unify but do not set up the knowledge.The science of economics is endeavouring to occupy a place among the nomological sciences, through mathematics, but the latter are in gross contradiction to the character of its object, even if the use of mathematics were a legitimate means in formulating the solution of many an economical problem.In economics, the unity of its principles must be demonstrated by ontological explanations, the base of this science, on the other hand, must be caught in those nomological sciences, which are consistent with the character of its object and its scientific thought.</p>[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="10px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]
